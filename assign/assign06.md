# The Demonstration


Your team should plan to present for the entire class period (including questions).  Please remember to invite the Swarm Engineering Capstone team, and any other individuals who you would like to attend the presentation. Your presentation should include the following elements:

- Demonstrate the system in action. If you have a UI, show it.
- Run your unit tests to demonstrate your testing framework, and describe what is happening.
- Explain what parts of your design are implemented, and which parts remain to be implemented by referencing your UML diagram. Briefly talk about how you plan to evolve the system to implement the remaining functionality.

**Plan your demonstration carefully.** You need to convince us that your system is 50% complete.  Make sure your demonstration convinces us!

**Please do a dry run before class to work out any "bugs" in your presentation and/or demo.**
