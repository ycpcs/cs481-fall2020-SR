**Due: [See Assignment Schedule](../schedule.html)**

This is a **Team** assignment. **Create a document in Google Docs so that team members can work collaboratively.**

# Tasks

There are three tasks which are part of this assignment.

## Proposal

Your team should then write a 2-4 page report describing your chosen/assigned project.  In order to properly define your team's work, you will need to research the existing work, and discuss with the Swarm Robotics Capstone Engineering team what needs to be created, refactored, modified, and/or added.

  Your team report should include the following information:

-   What is the URL of the main repository for your project?  (See next task.)
-   What is the current state of the system that you will be working on?
-   What problem is solved by the system your team will implement?
-   What are the major technical challenges you will face?
-   What technologies (programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware devices, etc.) will you use in the implementation of the system?
-   What kind of user interface will the system have?

Use diagrams as appropriate to convey this information clearly.

### Please Talk To Us!

We **strongly** encourage you to meet with the faculty and the Sewarm Robotics Capstone Engineering team to discuss project ideas before you submit your formal project proposal.

## Set up a GitHub repository

Your second task is to create a main repository for your project on [GitHub](https://github.com).

You should add all of your team members as contributors to the repository.  Also, add the instructor (GitHub user [DonaldHakeII](https://github.com/DonaldHakeII) ).  At a later date, you will likely also be adding members from the Swarm Robotics Engineering Capstone team, and perhaps technical advisors as contributors.

In the issue tracker for the main repository, create three labels:

-   **Feature (light blue)** - indicates a planned feature to be implemented
-   **Bug (red)** - indicates a problem with code that needs to be addressed
-   **In-progress (green with individual initials)** - one per team member indicating which tasks are currently being worked on.

Your team may add additional labels as desired.

You will likely be cloning the existing GitHub repositories.

## Set up your computing environment

Your third task is for each team member to set up a computing environment with the hardware and software you will need for the project.

You may use the physical space and computing equipment as you see fit.  Please be considerate of the needs of other teams, and please try to keep the environment neat and well-organized.  The back of the KEC118 is already reserved for the Radio Telescope project.  I suggest reserving the left middle bench for the Swarm Robotics team, but I'm not sure how this is going to work for this academic year, due to Covid-19.

Please note that you are **NOT** required to use one of the provided PCs: you can use your own laptop if you would prefer.
