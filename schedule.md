This is the course schedule for CS 481-102-SR (Swarm Robotics Project).

This schedule shows work completed before the start of the semester.  Given that you have planned on completing assignments 1, 3, and 4 by the first day of your class, I changed the Milestone dates to accommodate that initial effort.
