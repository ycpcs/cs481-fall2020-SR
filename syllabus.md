**Meeting Times:**

 - **I will be teaching 100% remotely this semester, and will not be on campus.  As such, all meetings, status updates, and assignment and Milestone presentations that I attend will be conducted via Zoom.**
 
 - **Mondays/Wednesdays (4:00p-5:15p):** These class sessions are resereved for you to work as a team, unencumbered by "interference" from the faculty.  You should notify your Swarm Robotics Capstone Engineering team members that you will be meeting as a team during these periods.  You are welcome to move these meeting times to accommodate all of your schedules (if you do, please let me know the updated meeting times). Since the Swarm Robotics team members are on co-op, they will likely only be able join you via Zoom, so I suggest scheduling these meetings via Zoom (even if you are in the project workspace together at that time) so that they can join you.  That will also allow me to join you, at your request (assuming I'm available).
 
 - **Thursdays (5:30p-6:45p)** These class sessions are reserved for status updates, assignment presentations, and Milestone presentations.  I will be scheduling and conducting these sessions via Zoom.  NOTE: It is not unusual for the class to run past the ending time, especially during status reports and Milestone presentations.  If you have another class scheduled immediately following this class, please let me know, and I will try to make accomodations. For Milestone presentations, you might need to make accommodations with your professor.<br>
 
**Location:** KEC 118 NOTE: The back 2 benches are reserved for the Radio Telescope project - I suggest reserving the middle bench on the left for the Swarm Robotics team.  Please remember that I will conduct all status meetings and presentations remotely via Zoom for the Fall 2020 semester.

### Course Description

The Swarm Robotics Senior Design (or Software Engineering) team will be working in collaboration with the Swarm Robotics Capstone Engineering team, who just finished their Capstone Engineering 1 course this past Summer.  You will be developing a substantial project with input and specifications provided by yourselves, in conjunction with the needs of the Swarm Robotics Engineering team.  This project will be developed under the direction of the course instructor.

**Prerequisites:**  CS 320 with a grade of 2.0 or higher (or PC from Spring 2020)<br>
**Credit:**		3 credit hours<br>
**Text:**  None

### Grading Policy

Your team's grade will be determined as a weighted average of the grades on the 7 assignments, as follows:

-   Assignment 1 - Team Project Proposal - **5%**
-   Assignment 2 - Weekly Progress Journals, Status Reports, Demonstrations - **20%**
-   Assignment 3 - Requirements - **10%**
-   Assignment 4 - Analysis and Design - **15%**
-   Assignment 5 - Minimal Working System - **10%**
-   Assignment 6 - 50% Working System - **10%**
-   Assignment 7 - Final Working System (10%), Presentation (10%), Report (10%) - **30%**

NOTE: You will be presenting your work for each of these assignments in class on the Thursdays they are due.  On the days that you do not have an assignment or Milestone due, you will be presenting status reports, as part of assignment 2.  Your weekly journal entries are **due EVERY Thursday by 5:15pm, immediately prior to EVERY class period, regardless of whatever else is due that day.**

Grades will be assigned on a 100-point scale according to the following table:

| Range             |  Grade   |
|:-----------------:|:--------:|
| ≥ 90 and ≤ 100    |   4.0    |
| ≥ 87 and &lt; 90  |   3.5    |
| ≥ 80 and &lt; 87  |   3.0    |
| ≥ 77 and &lt; 80  |   2.5    |
| ≥ 70 and &lt; 77  |   2.0    |
| ≥ 60 and &lt; 70  |   1.0    |
| &lt; 60           |    0     |

### Academic Integrity

York College's mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to
principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore,
academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic
dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating,
plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc.,
and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others
and claim such work as their own.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic
dishonesty, the faculty member must promptly notify the student in writing
and obtain confirmation of notification from the student.  The faculty
member then has ten business days from that written notification to
the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and
the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic
dishonesty will be kept on file in the student's permanent record. The
faculty member has full discretion to determine a suitable penalty for
the student, up to a course grade of 0.  This discretion is limited to
the course in which the dishonesty took place.  Students may not withdraw
from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty,
unless and until the accusation is withdrawn by the faculty member or
is overturned by the Student Welfare Committee or the Dean of Academic
Affairs.

Students who believe they have been unjustly charged or sanctioned must
discuss the situation with the faculty member and have 10 business
days thereafter to submit an appeal to Student Welfare Committee
through the Dean of Academic Affairs. If an appeal is filed, the
Student Welfare Committee will then conduct a hearing to review the
charge and/or sanction.  In the case of an egregious first offense, the
faculty member may request that the Student Welfare Committee conduct a
hearing and determine a sanction, which may involve academic probation,
suspension or dismissal from the College.

If the Dean of Academic Affairs determines that the academic dishonesty is
the student's second offense, the Dean will provide written notification
to the student, the faculty member, and the Department Chair. The Student
Welfare Committee will automatically conduct a hearing to review the
charge and decide on an appropriate sanction, which will involve academic
probation, suspension or dismissal from the College. Students who believe
the Student Welfare Committee has unjustly sanctioned them may submit
a written appeal to the Dean of Academic Affairs within 72 hours of
receiving notification of the Student Welfare Committee's sanction.

### Personal Technology Policy

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDAs, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate.  The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.


--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---



### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers.  Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations.  In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking.  Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.

### Students with Disabilities

If you are a student with a disability in need of a classroom accommodation and have not already registered with Linda Miller, Director of Disability Support Services, please contact her at 815-1785 or [lmille18@ycp.edu](mailto:lmille18@ycp.edu) to discuss policies and procedures related to disability services and to establish the accommodations for which you are eligible.
